# Africa-s-economic-indicators-from-2000-to-2020
✅ Process Overview:
I sourced the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivanbyone/population-and-gdp-africa
GitHub: https://lnkd.in/e6SMGwmQ

Process & Methodology:
I began with data cleaning and transformation using SQL Server, where I calculated several key economic indicators:
•	GDP per Capita
•	Population Growth Rate
•	Annual GDP Growth Rate
•	Cumulative GDP Over Time
To structure complex queries and streamline the analysis, I utilized Common Table Expressions (CTE).
Once the data was cleaned and enriched, I imported it into Power BI for in-depth analysis and interactive visualizations.

Key Analyses in Power BI:
•	Identified countries with GDP per Capita exceeding $3,000.
•	Conducted trend analysis to explore economic changes over time.
•	Examined population distribution across African regions.

 Major Insights:
•	South Africa, Egypt, and Nigeria emerged as Africa’s largest economies, although Nigeria’s large population limits its GDP per capita.
•	North Africa and South Africa drive a significant portion of Africa’s GDP despite smaller populations.
•	Smaller nations like Seychelles and Libya top GDP per capita rankings, driven by industries such as tourism and oil.
•	East and West Africa have large population shares but contribute less to total GDP, highlighting untapped economic potential.

Key Recommendations:
•	Foster inclusive and diversified economic growth in East and West Africa.
•	Invest in infrastructure, education, and digital technologies to boost economic capacity.
•	Strengthen regional trade integration through initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).

Skills Applied & Strengthened:
•	SQL: Data preparation, calculation, and advanced querying
•	Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard design
•	Economic Analysis: Interpreting data-driven economic trends and insights
